/**
   \brief Convert an integer to a string.

   The function itoa() converts the integer value from \c val into an
   ASCII representation that will be stored under \c s.  The caller
   is responsible for providing sufficient storage in \c s.

   \note The minimal size of the buffer \c s depends on the choice of
   radix. For example, if the radix is 2 (binary), you need to supply a buffer
   with a minimal length of 8 * sizeof (int) + 1 characters, i.e. one
   character for each bit plus one for the string terminator. Using a larger
   radix will require a smaller minimal buffer size.

   \warning If the buffer is too small, you risk a buffer overflow.

   Conversion is done using the \c radix as base, which may be a
   number between 2 (binary conversion) and up to 36.  If \c radix
   is greater than 10, the next digit after \c '9' will be the letter
   \c 'a'.
    
    If radix is 10 and val is negative, a minus sign will be prepended.

   The itoa() function returns the pointer passed as \c s.

   used to introduce the exponent.  The exponent always contains two
   digits; if the value is zero, the exponent is \c "00".

   If \c flags has the DTOSTRE_ALWAYS_SIGN bit set, a space character
   will be placed into the leading position for positive numbers.
